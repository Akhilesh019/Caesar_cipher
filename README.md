# Caesar_cipher

## Description
The Caesar Cipher is a simple and widely known encryption technique. This project implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python, allowing you to encrypt and decrypt messages easily.


## Usage
To encrypt a message, you can use the `encrypt` function with your chosen shift value:


message = "hello"
shift = 5
encrypted_message = encrypt(message, shift)
print(encrypted_message)  # Output: "mjqqt"

To encrypt a message, you can use the `encrypt` function with your chosen shift value:

encrypted_message = "mjqqt"
shift = 5
decrypted_message = decrypt(encrypted_message, shift)
print(decrypted_message)  # Output: "hello"
